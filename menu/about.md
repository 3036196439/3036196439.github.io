Integrated Framework for Stock Trend Prediction Using NLP, Knowledge Graph, and Deep Learning  
  
### Abstract  
  
The stock market is a complex and dynamic system influenced by various factors. To make informed investment decisions, investors need to analyze a vast amount of information, including news articles and industry reports. However, analyzing these textual data and predicting stock trends pose significant challenges. This research proposal aims to develop an integrated framework that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze news and industry reports, incorporates a knowledge graph to provide contextual information, and utilizes historical numerical data such as price (OCLHP) to provide additional information. Finally, it employs deep learning methods for accurate stock trend prediction.  
  
### Objective  
  
The objective of this research is to develop an integrated embedding model for stock trend prediction.  
  
### Methodology  
  
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collect textual data including relevant news articles (e.g., from Reddit), industry reports (e.g., from Bloomberg), and financial documents (e.g., from SEC) related to the stock market. Preprocess the data, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and entity recognition. Collect stock-related numerical data from finance APIs such as Yahoo Finance.  
2. **NLP Analysis and Text Embedding**: Utilize NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and entity relation extraction to analyze the textual data. Transform the processed text into embedding representations using word vectors or pre-trained language models like BERT.  
3. **Knowledge Graph Construction and Embedding**: Using an existing knowledge graph, construct a subgraph based on the extracted entities and their relationships. Treat key concepts such as stocks, companies, and individuals as entities, while their associations will be represented as relationships. Convert the existing textual embedding into advanced representations using the constructed knowledge graph.  
4. **Deep Learning Model Design and Training**: Design a deep learning model, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Transformer models, that takes the text embeddings and indicator embeddings as inputs to predict stock trends. Train the deep learning model using historical stock data.  
5. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Evaluate the model using historical stock data and optimize it based on evaluation results, including parameter tuning and increasing training data.
